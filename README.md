# MLFLOW

**Stack**
 - Python Language
 - MLFlow library
 - Sckit-learning library
 - Kaggle platform

**Motivation**

The motivation behind this project is to explore and implement MLFlow for managing machine learning experiments efficiently. By leveraging MLFlow‚Äôs tracking, model registry, and logging capabilities, we aim to streamline the ML lifecycle, making model training, evaluation, and deployment more organized and reproducible. Additionally, integrating Scikit-Learn and Kaggle allows us to work with real-world datasets and enhance our model-building workflow.
